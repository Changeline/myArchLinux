A couple of config files for my archlinux computer

## Desktop Environment
The desktop environment I use for my Archlinux installation is HyDE (https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE)

The installation is described in their wiki, here is just a short summary:
```
pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE ~/HyDE
cd ~/HyDE/Scripts
./install.sh
```

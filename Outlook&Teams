# How to Install Outlook and Teams as Desktop Apps (PWAs) on Arch Linux with Chrome

This guide explains how to install Microsoft Outlook and Teams as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) using Google Chrome on your Arch Linux system. PWAs provide a native app-like experience and integrate well with desktop environments, including Hyprland.

## Prerequisites

- Arch Linux system with yay (AUR helper)

## Step 4: Install as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

1. With the Outlook or Teams web app open in Chrome, click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner.
2. Go to "Save and share" (or look for **"Install Outlook"** or **"Install Teams"**).
3. Click **"Install Outlook"** or **"Install Teams"**.
    - Chrome may also show an install icon (a computer with a down arrow) in the address bar. Clicking this will also prompt installation.
4. Confirm the installation. The app will now open in its own window and appear in your application launcher menu (Hyprland’s app menu or similar).

## Step 5: Launch and Use Your New Apps

- You can now start Outlook and Teams like regular desktop apps from your application menu.
- They support features like notifications, dedicated windows, and can be pinned for quick access.

## Notes & Tips

- PWAs are the recommended way to use Teams and Outlook on Linux, as official native clients are no longer supported.
- The installed PWAs create desktop entries in `~/.local/share/applications/`, making them easy to launch and integrate with Hyprland and your workflow.
- For uninstalling, right-click the app icon in Chrome’s app launcher or remove the corresponding `.desktop` file.

You now have Outlook and Teams installed as desktop-like apps on your Arch Linux system, fully integrated with your Hyprland environment and ready for daily use.
